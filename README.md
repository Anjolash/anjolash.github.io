# Objective 

- What is the key challenge? 

The Head of Marketing is looking to identify the top-performing YouTubers in Canada for 2024 to optimize influencer marketing campaigns for the remainder of the year. The goal is to pinpoint creators who align with brand values and reach the right audience for maximum impact.

- What is the ideal solution? 

Build an interactive dashboard that highlights the top Canadian YouTubers in 2024, offering data-driven insights such as:

Subscriber count
Total views
Number of videos
Engagement metrics (e.g., likes, comments, shares)

This dashboard will help the marketing team quickly assess which YouTubers are the best fit for collaboration, ensuring informed and impactful marketing decisions throughout the year.



## User Story

As the Head of Marketing, I want to use a dashboard that analyzes YouTube channel data in Canada. 

This dashboard should enable me to identify the top-performing channels based on metrics such as subscriber base, total views, and engagement rates. 

With this information, I can make informed decisions about which YouTubers are best to collaborate with, ensuring each marketing campaign is highly effective.

---

## Data Source

### What data is needed to achieve our objective?

We need comprehensive data on the top Canadian YouTubers in 2024, including:
- Channel names
- Total subscribers
- Total views
- Total videos uploaded
- Engagement metrics (e.g., likes, comments, shares)

This data will support identifying channels with strong audience engagement and growth potential for marketing collaborations.



- Where is the data coming from? 
The data is sourced from Kaggle (an Excel extract), [see here to find it.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavyadhingra00020/top-100-social-media-influencers-2024-countrywise?resource=download)


# Stages

# Design 

## Dashboard components required 
- What should the dashboard contain based on the requirements provided?

To understand what it should contain, we need to figure out what questions we need the dashboard to answer:

1. Who are the top 10 YouTubers with the most subscribers?
2. Which 3 channels have uploaded the most videos?
3. Which 3 channels have the most views?
4. Which 3 channels have the highest average views per video?
5. Which 3 channels have the highest views per subscriber ratio?
6. Which 3 channels have the highest subscriber engagement rate per video uploaded?

For now, these are some of the questions we need to answer, this may change as we progress down our analysis. 


## Dashboard mockup

- What should it look like? 

Some of the data visuals that may be appropriate in answering our questions include:

1. Table
2. Treemap
3. Scorecards
4. Horizontal bar chart

# Development

## Pseudocode

### General Approach to Creating the Solution:
1. **Obtain the Data:**
   - Collect the data on top Canadian YouTubers for 2024, including their subscriber count, total views, and engagement metrics.

2. **Data Exploration (in Excel):**
   - Open the dataset in Excel to inspect and explore.
   - Identify missing values, outliers, or potential errors.
   - Note the columns of interest for analysis.

3. **Load the Data into SQL Server:**
   - Create a database and load the cleaned data from Excel into SQL Server for further processing.

4. **Data Cleaning (SQL):**
   - Remove unnecessary columns.
   - Handle missing or inconsistent data.
   - Standardize formats (e.g., ensure subscriber counts and views are numeric).
   
5. **Data Validation (SQL):**
   - Verify that the cleaned data is accurate and complete.
   - Run queries to check the integrity of the data (e.g., no nulls in important columns like subscriber count).
   
6. **Data Visualization (Power BI):**
   - Import the cleaned data from SQL Server into Power BI.
   - Create visualizations for key metrics like subscriber growth, video count, and engagement rates.
   
7. **Generate Insights:**
   - Use the Power BI dashboard to analyze trends and identify the top Canadian YouTubers based on engagement, views, and subscribers.

8. **Document the Process and Findings:**
   - Write a detailed report explaining the data exploration, cleaning, analysis, and insights generated from the dashboard.
   
9. **Publish the Data and Results:**
   - Upload the project, including the Power BI dashboard and documentation, to GitHub Pages for public access.

## Data Exploration Notes

### Initial Observations of the Dataset:
1. **Relevant Data Columns:**
   - At least 4 columns contain the critical information needed for the analysis (e.g., channel names, subscribers, views, engagement metrics), indicating no need for additional data collection.

2. **Channel ID Format:**
   - The first column seems to hold YouTube channel IDs, often separated by the `@` symbol. We need to extract the proper channel names for easier reference in our analysis.

3. **Language Discrepancies:**
   - Some headers and data are in a different language. We need to determine whether these columns are relevant. If needed, we can translate or remove them to ensure consistency.

4. **Excessive Data:**
   - Thereâ€™s more data in the dataset than we need for this analysis. Non-essential columns will be removed to focus on the key metrics.



## Data cleaning 
- What do we expect the clean data to look like? (What should it contain? What contraints should we apply to it?)

The aim is to refine our dataset to ensure it is structured and ready for analysis. 

The cleaned data should meet the following criteria and constraints:

- Only relevant columns should be retained.
- All data types should be appropriate for the contents of each column.
- No column should contain null values, indicating complete data for all records.

Below is a table outlining the constraints on our cleaned dataset:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Number of Rows | 100 |
| Number of Columns | 4 |

And here is a tabular representation of the expected schema for the clean data:

| Column Name | Data Type | Nullable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| channel_name | VARCHAR | NO |
| total_subscribers | INTEGER | NO |
| total_views | INTEGER | NO |
| total_videos | INTEGER | NO |


- What steps are needed to clean and shape the data into the desired format?

1. Remove unnecessary columns by only selecting the ones you need
2. Extract Youtube channel names from the first column
3. Rename columns using aliases







### Transform the data 



```sql
/*
# 1. Select the required columns
# 2. Extract the channel name from the 'NAME' column
*/

-- 1.
SELECT
    SUBSTRING(NAME, 1, CHARINDEX('@', NAME) -1) AS channel_name,  -- 2.
    total_subscribers,
    total_views,
    total_videos

FROM
    top_canada_youtubers_2024
```


### Create the SQL view 

```sql
/*
# 1. Create a view to store the transformed data
# 2. Cast the extracted channel name as VARCHAR(100)
# 3. Select the required columns from the top_uk_youtubers_2024 SQL table 
*/

CREATE VIEW view_updated_canada AS

SELECT
	CAST(SUBSTRING(NAME, 1, CHARINDEX('@', NAME) - 1) AS VARCHAR(100)) as channel_name,
	total_subscribers,
	total_views,
	total_videos
FROM
	updated_canada;

```
# Testing 

- What data quality and validation checks are you going to create?

Here are the data quality tests conducted:

## Row count check
```sql
/*
# Count the total number of records (or rows) are in the SQL view
*/

--1 . Row count check

SELECT COUNT(*) as no_of_rows
FROM view_updated_canada;


```

![Row count check](assets/images/Screenshot777.png)



## Column count check
### SQL query 
```sql
/*
# Count the total number of columns (or fields) are in the SQL view
*/

--2. Column count check

SELECT 
	COUNT(*) as column_count
FROM 
	INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE 
	TABLE_NAME = 'view_updated_canada';
```
### Output 
![Column count check](assets/images/Screenshot778.png)



## Data type check
### SQL query 
```sql
/*
# Check the data types of each column from the view by checking the INFORMATION SCHEMA view
*/

--3. Data type check

SELECT
	COLUMN_NAME,
	DATA_TYPE
FROM
	INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE
	TABLE_NAME = 'view_updated_canada'
```
### Output
![Data type check](assets/images/Screenshot779.png)


## Duplicate count check
### SQL query 
```sql
/*
# 1. Check for duplicate rows in the view
# 2. Group by the channel name
# 3. Filter for groups with more than one row
*/

--4. Duplicate records check

SELECT channel_name,
	COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count
FROM
	view_updated_canada
GROUP BY
	channel_name
HAVING
	COUNT(*) > 1;
```
### Output
